# Tutorial on Configuring your EC2 instance as an FTP server. 

## Full Step-by-Step guide with Snapshots to describe and illustrate how to configure an EC2 Instance as an FTP Server.

### This project will display how to set up and configure an FTP server on an EC2 instance, including user creation, security group adjustments, and WinSCP access verification.

*Create a new EC2 Instance 
* Log in to Linux Terminal via SSH on the EC2 instance
* Run Neccasary Configuration Files inside Linux and Vim Editor for configuration of the FTP Server to work with the EC2 Instance.
* Create a Username and Password in the Linux Terminal 
* Copy and paste the EC2 Instance Public IP Address in WinSCP, as well as enter the Username and Password created in the Linux Terminal into WinSCP
* Reconfigure both the security group inbound rules as well as reconfigure the VIM Editor.
* Logging back into WinSCP after both the reconfiguration is complete for the Security Group and the VIM Editor.


#### Step-by-Step Instructions on how to set up and configure an FTP server on an EC2 instance, including user creation, security group adjustments, and WinSCP access verification.
  
* Click on Launch Instance EC2>Select your Instance Name, AMI, Key Pair & Security Group, finally click Launch Instance.
* Select your newly Created Instance> Click Connect at the top of the Instance, SSH Client from the options, Select for copying your Instance via SSH> Type into your Windows Search Box "Command Prompt" and Select "Administrator">Paste your SSH Instance Code into Command Prompt and Press Enter.

* Inside the Vim Editor, Press Shift + I on your keyboard to Enter Insert Mode and then Scroll Down to where it is written "anonymous_enable=NO" & change the NO to a YES, then scroll further down to where there are two parallel lines 1) asccii_upload_enable=YES 2)ascii_download_enable=YES remove the Hashtag Comment Section from both of them.>Press Esc key on your keyboard to exit Insert Mode followed by pressing":wq and Enter" on your keyboard to exit the Vim Editor.

(commands creating a new username and password) 
* Go back to your EC2 Instance, Select it, Copy the Public IP Address in the Details Section> Open WinSCP from the search tab on Windows (no photo)> In the WinSCP Window, click on New Site, In the Host Name Box, put your EC2 Public IP Address(that you copied over before) as well as put your Username and Password (that you created in Linux earlier) in their respective boxes>
